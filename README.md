# Introduction

This project is a FastAPI-based blog management system that provides a robust and scalable backend for handling blogs, users, comments, and follow relationships. Built with performance and security in mind, it offers a seamless experience for user authentication, role-based access control, and efficient content management.

### Key Features:
- âœ… User Authentication & Authorization â€“ Secure login, JWT-based authentication, and role-based access control (admin, author, reader).
- âœ… Blog Management â€“ Create, update, delete, and retrieve blogs with structured data handling.
- âœ… User & Follow System â€“ Allow users to follow/unfollow others and manage their social interactions.
- âœ… Comment System â€“ Enable users to add, edit, and delete comments on blog posts.
- âœ… Fast & Scalable â€“ Powered by FastAPI, ensuring high performance with asynchronous request handling.
- âœ… Database Integration â€“ Uses MySQL with SQLAlchemy for efficient data management.
- âœ… Environment Configuration â€“ Secure .env file usage for managing sensitive configurations.

This API serves as a foundation for blog-based applications and can be extended to support additional features like notifications, analytics, and more. ðŸš€

# Authentication and Authorization

The application uses JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. Users can have one of the following roles:

- **reader** : Can read blogs and create comments.
- **author** : Can create, update, and delete their own blogs and comments.
- **admin** : Has full control over all resources.

### 1. Login

- **Endpoint**: /auth/login
- **Method**: POST
- **Request**:

    ```json
    {
        "username": "author1",
        "password": "password123"
    }
    ```
- **Response(Success)**:

    ```json
    {
        "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "token_type": "bearer"
    }
    ```

### 2. Register

- **Endpoint**: /auth/register
- **Method**: POST
- **Request**:

    ```json
    {
        "username": "newuser",
        "email": "newuser@example.com",
        "password": "password123",
        "role": "author"
    }
    ```
- **Response(Success)**:

    ```json
    {
        "id": 3,
        "username": "newuser",
        "email": "newuser@example.com",
        "role": "author"
    }
    ```

Endpoints requiring authentication are protected using **get_current_user**, while specific roles are enforced using **role_required**

Ensure that pip (Python's package installer) is installed. You can check this by running:

```sh
pip --version
```

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NewGenesis04/Blog-API-FastAPI.git
cd Blog-Fast-API
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate 
```

### 3. Install Dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following:

```ini
DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/db_name"
JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
```
    
### 5. Run Migrations:

Delete the alembic folder and run these commands:

```sh
alembic init
```

Modify the alembic/env.py file:
```sh
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()
config.set_main_option('sqlalchemy.url', os.getenv('DATABASE_URL'))
```
Create migration file:

```sh
alembic revision -m "Your migration message"
```

Apply migrations to the database:

```sh
alembic upgrade head
```

### 6. Start the Application:
